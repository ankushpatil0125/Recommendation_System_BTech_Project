# Recommendation_System_BTech_Project


The paper presented at the 4th International Conference on Innovative Computing and Communication (ICICC 2021) discusses the development of a recommendation system aimed at connecting small or part-time workers (such as electricians and carpenters) with potential customers for informal jobs. The system utilizes content-based filtering techniques to match workers' skills with customer requirements, facilitating efficient job recommendations. Unlike traditional systems that focus on formal employment sectors, this system targets informal workers and aims to bridge the gap between them and potential customers.

Key points of the paper include:
- Introduction to recommender systems and their application in job recommendations.
- Problem definition highlighting the manual nature of job finding processes for small workers and the lack of focus on informal job sectors in existing recommendation systems.
- Description of the proposed system setup, including tools and techniques used such as Jupyter Notebook, Python, and scikit-learn.
- Utilization of content-based filtering approach for recommending jobs to workers and workers to customers based on skills and job requirements.
- Dataset creation process using manually entered data and tools like Mockaroo due to the unavailability of existing datasets for informal workers.
- Explanation of the Vector Space Model and TF-IDF Vectorizer used for text representation and relevance ranking.
- Literature survey discussing various recommendation system approaches and methodologies used in previous research papers.
- Implementation details including the recommendation algorithm used, cleaning and processing of datasets, and recommendation flow.
- Presentation of results demonstrating the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendation system in recommending jobs to workers and workers to customers in the required work field.

Overall, the paper concludes that the developed recommendation system successfully provides accurate job recommendations for both customers and small workers in informal job sectors, thereby addressing the need for efficient job matching in these sectors.
